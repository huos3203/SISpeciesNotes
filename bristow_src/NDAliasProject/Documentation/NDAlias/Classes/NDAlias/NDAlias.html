<H1>NDAlias</H1><hr>
<b>Abstract: </b>A class to access the Alias Manager from Cocoa 
<hr><br>
Your application can use a <TT>NDAlias</TT> to refere to file system objects (that is, files, directories, and volumes) in a way that does expect the file system objects path to be maintained. The user then can move or rename the file system object with out your program lossing track of it. This behaviour is not always desirable, for intance with library resources. But for file system objects like documents of user folders, it is what Mac OS users have come to expect
